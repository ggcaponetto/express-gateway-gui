This is a simple GUI for [https://www.express-gateway.io/](https://www.express-gateway.io/).
The repository is under **active** development, at the moment this means:
- Wild git commits
- No docs
- Expect things to break

## contribution: getting started

1. ```npm i```
1. ``lerna bootstrap``

Hack a little bit with the preview:
1. ``cd packages/gui && npm start``
